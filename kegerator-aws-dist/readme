Readme file for the AWS portion of Kegerator in the Cloud

Kegerator in the Cloud is served by components running in Amazon Web Services.
All services are deployed within the same region.

The readme files contained within this distro are not intended to replace the vast amount of 
documentation available at http://aws.amazon.com/documentation

The recommended order of creation is ..

1. VPC
2. Elasticache/Redis cache node in private subnet
3. EC2 instance in public subnet for Node.js app
4. Lambda function
5. SNS topic

Data enters AWS at the SNS topic .. SNS -> Lambda f(x) -> Node app -> Redis
Dashboard page queries the Node.js app, which in turn queries Redis for data

Enjoy!
